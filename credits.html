                  So just a little about me... I am Jackie Aljam, I am from Coldwater Indian Band. My mother is Grace Aljam (also from Coldwater Indian Band) & my father is James V. Bob (Sts'ailes aka Chehalis, British Columbia). I have 3 other siblings named Manie Aljam, Dion Aljam & Tyson Aljam. My Grandma on my mother's side is from Lower Nicola Indian Band, and my Grandpa on my mom's side is from Upper Nicola aka Douglas Lake. My grandma Ada George on my father's side is from Coldwater Indian Band & my grandpa John V. Mack on my father's side is from Sts'ailes. I grew up around Merritt, always went to school at Coldwater Indian Band School but I eventually finished school at Kenguard Learning Centre and graduated in 2017. I have 3 children with my husband Davis Moses of Lower Nicola Indian Band. I have many hobbies, I like to keep my options open for when it comes to doing something. I have always enjoyed technology and its ever-changing face. I still live in the surrounding areas of Merritt, British Columbia. I think I have the biggest family ever, on my father's side of the family he had 12 siblings, and my mother's side has 9 siblings, that makes for a lot of family.
                </p>
                  <p> My grandparents on my mother's side always got their kids together, there wasn't a season or a holiday that we didn't get together. I like to try to keep that tradition alive, I feel like we don't get together enough. We lose that closeness, that bond that many families have. Speaking of my grandparents on my mother's side, they were never just our grandparents, growing up everyone called them "grandpa" or "grandma". They always helped those who needed the help, never said no unless they had too.
                  </p>
                  <p>My grandparents on my father's side of the family, I never knew them. I never knew how big my father's side of the family was until my father passed away. HIS SIDE IS SOOOOO MUCH BIGGER. It is so weird because I always thought my mom's side of the family was always the biggest one, but combine both sides, I have over 30 first cousins..... weird right. </p>

            <h1 style="color:black">I enjoyed making this, at first making this felt hard and uneasy to do. But now I have realized that I fully enjoyed this. I plan to try to keep this up... maybe even dip more into it.
