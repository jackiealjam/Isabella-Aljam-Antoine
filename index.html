              <p>So I had a hard time choosing what to make my website about, but once I figured out what I wanted to do it all became clearer and clearer. Isabella has been so much a part of my life growing up, I was 16 when she was born. As I watched my sister Dion raise her, I had no idea how much work raising a child would be. I wanted to dedicate my website to her because I want to show her how much she has accomplished and overcome so many things. So Isabella & the world, this is what I came up with I hope you enjoy my content.</p>

              <p>Isabella, there are some things I didn't tell you I was adding, mainly because I wanted you to see just how much we love seeing you go out there and enjoy life. I had asked some family members to write something up, and I will put it on here for you and the world to see.</p>
              <p>I had alot more photos of her life, but I here she is with what i had and could do. I hope to keep adding more and maybe even some more videos.</p>
