              <p>So Miss Isabella Aljam Antoine, you are now a graduate of Merritt Secondary School of Merritt, BC. I couldn't be more proud of you, and what you have accomplished in your short 17 years. As your uncle Davis and I have watched you grow and grow, becoming your own person, taking those leaps into the unknown, we will always support and help you with your dreams. There are going to be times where you will feel life will bring you places but just know, you will never face them alone if you do not want too. I love you Isabella.</p>
              <p>So I had a hard time choosing what to make my website about, but once I figured out what I wanted to do it all became clearer and clearer. Isabella has been so much a part of my life growing up, I was 16 when she was born. As I watched my sister Dion raise her, I had no idea how much work raising a child would be. I wanted to dedicate my website to her because I want to show her how much she has accomplished and overcome so many things. So Isabella & the world, this is what I came up with I hope you enjoy my content.</p>

              <p>Isabella, there are some things I didn't tell you I was adding, mainly because I wanted you to see just how much we love seeing you go out there and enjoy life. I had asked some family members to write something up, and I will put it on here for you and the world to see.</p>
              <p>I had alot more photos of her life, but I here she is with what i had and could do. I hope to keep adding more and maybe even some more videos.</p>
